# Tolino Test

Experiments to see what kind of app works great for this

- [ ] To-Do list
- [ ] Toggl Track, but don't tick every second
- [ ] Calendar/next event reminder

## Things to learn

- How does color translate? (And also how would it work with future color e-ink panels)
- Is "no animation" the only option? Or are there still cases where some animation helps?
- How to minimize the app as much as possible? Tolino has very little storage.
  - Or just remember how to allow app to be move to SD card in the first place
- Any good way to compensate for the virtual buttons?
